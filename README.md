# Looping Practice

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this lab. Then, open it in sublime and run the test suite with the `rspec` command. 
2. This lab requires you to write a series of methods that use the different looping constructs we've covered in this unit. **Read the comments in `simple_looping.rb`.** This is the file where you'll be coding your solution. The comments will help you to solve the lab and get the tests passing. 
3. Each method takes in an argument of an integer. If you call one of the methods with an argument of `4`, your method should loop and `puts` out a phrase `4` times. If you call the same method with an argument of `10`, your method should loop and `puts` out that phrase `10` times. 
3. As you move through the lab, think about the differences between the looping constructs you're utilizing. What are some advantages to using certain constructs? Disadvantages?
